What does this program do?
This is a memory scanner and editor for the game Lost Ark. It lets you:

#Attach to the Lost Ark game process.
Scan the game’s memory for specific values (like health, gold, or other in-game numbers).
Edit those values (cheat by changing them).
Save or copy memory addresses for later use.
Start/Stop a bot (though the bot logic is not fully implemented in this code).


How does it work?

Memory Scanner:

You type in a value (like "100" for gold or health).
The program searches the game’s memory for that value.
It shows you all the memory addresses where that value is found.


Memory Editor:

You can select an address and change its value to whatever you want.


Bot Tab:

There are buttons to start/stop a bot, but the actual bot code is not finished (it just shows a message).




What is it meant for?

Cheating: Changing in-game values (like health, gold, etc.) to give yourself an advantage.
Automation: The bot tab suggests it could be used to automate gameplay (like grinding or farming), but this part is not fully built yet.
Reverse Engineering: Finding and editing game values for research or modding.


Is it safe/legal?

No. Using such tools in online games is usually against the Terms of Service and can get your account banned.
Risky: The program accesses game memory directly, which can cause crashes or be detected by anti-cheat software.

In short: This is a cheat tool for Lost Ark, allowing you to find and change game values, and potentially automate gameplay. Using it risks your account and is against the game’s rules.
