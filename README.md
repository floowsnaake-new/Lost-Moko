# Lost-Moko (LM)
Bot for the game Lost Ark called Lost Moko or LM for short.

I am working on developing an bot for the game Lost Ark in C, utilizing C programming language on a Linux platform while its running in Proton. My goal is to create a program that can interact with the game environment, analyze game states, and make intelligent decisions to navigate through levels, avoid obstacles, or achieve specific objectives within the game.

To accomplish this, I am focusing on understanding the game's input/output mechanisms, such as capturing user inputs or reading game data from memory or files, and then programming the bot to respond appropriately. This involves implementing algorithms for decision-making, pathfinding, and possibly some form of artificial intelligence or heuristic analysis to improve the botâ€™s performance.

Additionally, I am exploring Linux-specific tools and libraries that can aid in automating inputs, such as those compatible with Wayland.
